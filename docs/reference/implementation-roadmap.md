## Overview

The implementation is organized into 6 major phases, each with tightly scoped goals. This ensures:
- Incremental value delivery
- Reduced technical risk
- Clear validation points
- Manageable scope

Each phase includes:
- Specific milestones
- Validation criteria
- Deferred items
- Technical considerations

## Phase 0: Cleanup & Pivot Finalization
**Duration**: 3-5 days

### Purpose
Finalize the pivot from "memorials" to "alumni profiles" and prepare the system for the new model.

- Role-based access (`admin`, `editor`, `contributor`, `viewer`)
- Per-profile and per-university roles
- Public/private profile visibility logic
- Profile permission dashboard per university
- Remove dual sign-in model

### Validation
- Firebase emulators for security rules
- RBAC integration tests

- [ ] Profile preview before publishing
- [ ] Admin toggle for publishing profile
- [ ] Edit workflow reuses creation UI with pre-filled data

### Key UX
- Vertical timeline with smooth scroll
- Optional fields visually marked
- Profile goes live only after admin review

### Validation
- Change diffing
- Form validation
- Auto-save and local restore after crash

### Deferred
- Real-time multi-user editing (Phase 5)

## Phase 4: Media Uploads, Comments & Notifications
**Duration**: 2 weeks

### Purpose
