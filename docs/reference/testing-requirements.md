# Testing Requirements

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementing features
- Write failing tests for bug fixes before fixing
- Follow the red-green-refactor cycle
- Tests must be meaningful and test behavior, not implementation

## Test Types
### Unit Tests
- Test individual components and functions
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Test business logic thoroughly

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Test data flow between components
- Test API integrations
- Test state management

### End-to-End Tests
- Test critical user flows
- Test complete features
- Test real user scenarios
- Test system integration

## Test Quality
- Tests must be deterministic
- No flaky tests allowed
- Clear test descriptions
- Proper test isolation
- No test interdependence

## Test Data
- Use realistic test data
- No mock data in production code
- Test data should be maintainable
- Test data should be version controlled

## Test Coverage
- Critical paths must be covered
- Edge cases must be tested
- Error conditions must be tested
- Performance critical code must be tested

## Test Maintenance
- Tests must be kept up to date
- Remove obsolete tests
- Refactor tests when code changes
- Keep test code clean and maintainable

## Test Environment
- Tests must run in CI/CD
- Tests must be fast
- Tests must be reliable
- Environment must be properly configured

## Best Practices
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Keep tests focused and simple
- Use proper test utilities and helpers
- Document complex test scenarios
