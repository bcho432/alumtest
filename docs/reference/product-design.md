# Product Design Document

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, user-focused view of the alumni profiles platform. It details user journeys, problems, solutions, all product functions, and the UI/UX, with explicit mapping to user roles and permissions. It is intended for product managers, designers, and stakeholders who need to understand the platform's value, user experience, and every feature it offers.

## 1. Problem Statement

Universities and their alumni communities lack a unified, secure, and engaging platform to manage, celebrate, and discover alumni stories. Existing solutions are fragmented, lack collaboration, and do not provide robust privacy or role-based access. There is a need for a scalable, university-managed system that:
- Empowers universities to curate and manage alumni profiles
- Enables alumni and contributors to share life stories, achievements, and media
- Provides a safe, permissioned environment for collaboration
- Delivers a modern, discoverable, and engaging public experience

## 5. User Flows & Edge Cases

### A. Profile Lifecycle

### C. Media Management
- **Upload:** Drag-and-drop, preview, validation (type, size, count)
- **Processing:** Thumbnails and optimizations are shown as progress bars
- **Delete:** Only uploader or admin can delete; confirmation modal
- **Edge:** If upload fails, user can retry; if media is flagged, admin reviews

### D. Commenting
- **Add:** Verified users can comment; unverified see prompt
- **Threading:** Replies up to 3 levels
- **Moderation:** Admins can delete, approve, or reject
- **Edge:** Spam/abuse triggers moderation queue; rate limits enforced

**Edge Cases:**
- If an editor is removed, their drafts remain but cannot be published.
- If a profile is archived, all comments and media are hidden from public.

## 13. Comment Moderation

- **Comment Submission:**
  - Only verified users can comment.
  - Comments are threaded (up to 3 levels).
  - Comments are visible immediately but may be flagged.

- **Moderation Triggers:**
  - Users can report comments (spam, abuse, off-topic).
  - Automated filters flag comments with banned words or spam patterns.
  - Rate limits prevent spam (e.g., max 5 comments/minute).

- **Moderation Workflow:**
  1. Flagged comments appear in admin moderation queue.
  2. Admin reviews flagged comments, can approve, reject, or delete.
  3. Authors are notified if their comment is rejected or deleted.
  4. Repeated offenders can be muted or banned by admin (post-MVP).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If a comment is deleted, all its replies are hidden.
  - If a user is banned, all their comments are hidden until reviewed.
  - Admins can restore mistakenly deleted comments.

- **User Controls:**
  - Users can edit or delete their own comments (unless locked by admin).
  - Users can view moderation status of their comments (pending, approved, rejected).

  - Detailed logs of all admin/user actions (role changes, profile edits, moderation actions) accessible via a dashboard tab for compliance and troubleshooting.

- **Profile Edit History & Versioning:**
  - Timeline of all changes to a profile, with the ability to view previous versions, see who made each change, and restore prior states.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO):**
  - Support for institutional login (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, university SSO) for easier and more secure access.

- **Notification Preferences:**
  - User settings to control which notifications are received (in-app, email, frequency, types).

- **Chatbot/AI Features:**
  - AI-powered assistant for answering questions, helping users fill out profiles, or providing automated support.

- **Spam/AI Moderation for Comments:**
  - Automated detection and flagging of spam or abusive comments using AI/ML models, with admin review queue.
